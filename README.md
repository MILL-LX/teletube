## Set up the Pi

### OS

Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to create the OS image for your Pi.

This project has been developed on a Raspberry Pi 4 running *Trixie 64-bit Light* with SSH enabled and a public key installed. Installing the public key will make your life easier if you like to use the VSCode Remote SSH plugin to develop directly on the Pi.

### Tooling

#### Update the OS packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

#### Install Tools and Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install \
    git \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
```
